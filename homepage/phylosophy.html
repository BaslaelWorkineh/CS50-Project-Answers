    <h1>My Life Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Be Great or Be Nothing</p>
  </div>

  <DIV>
    <p id="final" class="fs-4">
YOUR DAILY LIVING, when you look at it very deeply,
 has no meaning. You are striving, wanting money, position,
 prestige, and when you do have it, what is it? You have not
 found out for yourself if life has real meaning. You ask what
 the purpose or goal of life is, rather than the meaning.
 The purpose can be invented by clever people, or you can
 invent purpose out of your misery, confusion and conflict.
 But the purpose is not the meaning. The meaning is to find
 out for yourself by looking at yourself, the depth of your heart,
  the depth of your feelings, the depth of your thought.

    So, when you look at your life, the petty quarrels,
    the shallow mind, argumentative, brutish, narrow,
     when you look at all that, do you not feel shattered
     and shocked? Donâ€™t you feel the life you are living daily,
     going to work from morning till night for forty or fifty years,
     coming home, quarrelling, tired out, sleeping with your wife
     or husband, has really no meaning? So, can you look at it
     without getting depressed, without wanting to change it?
     If you want to change it, you will change it to another
     pattern which will be equally confusing.
     When your mind is confused and out of that confusion you choose,
     what you choose must be the result of your confusion.
     This is your life, your daily travail,
      your anxieties, your hurts, your pain.
      Just look at it.
