# Wild Life Simulation

## Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/06Qxkgur6gU>

Wild life simulation is a project which is made for the cs50.

## Description:

In my final project, I created a complex wildlife simulation featuring two distinct animal species - the fox and the sheep. Both species are capable of engaging in a variety of activities such as hunting, breeding, eating, drinking, and sleeping. The animals are autonomous and will wander on their own in search of food or water. If they become tired, they will rest and sleep.

There is also a grass component in the simulation which is a vital food source for the sheep. If the grass is consumed, it will regenerate within a short period of time, allowing the ecosystem to remain balanced. The animals will grow over time, and each species has its own specific growth period.

The fox species can give birth to a litter of 3 to 6 baby foxes, while the sheep can give birth to 1 to 3 baby sheep. These newborns will grow over time, and the simulation accurately represents their growth periods.

If any of the animals wander outside the bounds of the simulation, they will be automatically respawned to the center of the game scene. Overall, this simulation provides a realistic and dynamic representation of a wildlife ecosystem, with the animals and grass interacting in a complex and engaging way.

In addition to the features mentioned above, this wildlife simulation project also includes several other interesting elements. For example, the newborn animals in the simulation start off at a size of 1f and gradually grow until they reach a size of 3f. This adds a level of realism to the simulation, as it accurately reflects the growth process of real animals.

The pregnancy period for both the fox and the sheep is set to 10 seconds, which is a relatively short period of time. This was done to keep the simulation moving at a fast pace and to prevent it from becoming too slow or stagnant.

Another interesting aspect of this project is that the animals have a life expectancy of 2 minutes. This means that they will eventually die of old age if they are not killed by a predator or die of starvation or thirst. This adds a sense of urgency to the simulation and encourages the player to take action to keep the animals alive and thriving.

The game ecosystem was designed using Blender, a powerful 3D modeling and animation software. This allowed for the creation of a detailed and realistic environment for the animals to inhabit. The low poly style of the game's graphics also adds to the aesthetic appeal of the project, while still allowing for smooth gameplay and performance.

Overall, this wildlife simulation project is a great example of the power of game development tools like Unity and Blender to create realistic and engaging simulations. It demonstrates the potential of these tools to create educational and entertaining experiences that can teach players about the complexities of real-world ecosystems.

Another notable feature of this wildlife simulation project is the user interface (UI) that displays various statistics and information about the animals and their behavior. Specifically, the UI includes counters for the number of animals born, the number of animals that have died, the total population of each species, and the amount of food and water that has been consumed.

These counters are a valuable tool for monitoring the health and status of the ecosystem, and they allow the player to make informed decisions about how to manage the animals and their environment. For example, if the population of one species is growing too rapidly, the player may need to take action to manage the population by controlling hunting or breeding behaviors.

The UI is also designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand, with clear and concise labels and intuitive graphics. This helps to make the simulation accessible to a wide range of users, including those who may not be familiar with game development or wildlife ecology.

Overall, the addition of the UI to this wildlife simulation project is an excellent example of how user interface design can enhance the functionality and usability of a game or application. It demonstrates the importance of clear and effective communication in creating engaging and informative experiences for users.
